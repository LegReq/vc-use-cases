  John is on the vacation of a lifetime, travelling the world. Falling
  ill, he
  visits a health clinic in a country in which he does not live. At
  the clinic,
  he is asked for proof of identity. He provides a credential that
  verifies his
  name and address, but elects not to disclose his marital status nor
  his social
  security number, as those are neither requested nor required at this
  clinic.
  He further marks the disclosure as expiring in 30 days&mdash;he does
  not want
  his information verifiable after that time.
