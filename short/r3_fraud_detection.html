  On a bright Sunday, Oskar remembers that he still needs to buy his
  wife a
  precious gift for their wedding anniversary. However, he is acutely
  aware that
  it is precisely in weekends that gangs set up fraudulent web shops
  that claim
  to sell such gifts, while in fact they only take the cash, and
  disappear on
  Mondays. So before actually purchasing a gift from the web shop of
  his choice,
  he requests the shop to provide a credential issued by the chamber
  of commerce,
  that contains proof of legitimacy. After having verified that the
  shop is
  legit, he can purchase his gift.
