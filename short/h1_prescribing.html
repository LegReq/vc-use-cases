  Barney is a physician, and has recently become board certified in
  his state.
  The state's board issues Barney a digital certificate confirming
  that he is
  certified to practice medicine in that state. Barney can now use
  this
  certificate when writing prescriptions and referrals, thereby
  improving
  accountability and verifiability.
