  Jane is opening an account at MidBank in Finland. As part of that
  process,
  the bank asks her to provide two from a variety of possible sources
  to confirm
  her identity &mdash; a so-called &quot;Know Your Customer&quot;
  check. She
  selects government-supplied <a>verifiable credentials</a> that
  confirm she
  receives postal mail at a certain address and that she has a
  national ID card.
  Confirming these allows the bank to open her account and be
  confident in her
  identity when she conducts transactions.

  Now that the account is open, Jane is issued a digitally-signed
  <a>credential</a> for her checking account at MidBank. This
  <a>credential</a>
  verifies that Jane has an account at MidBank and has access to her
  associated
  checking account. Since MidBank (and all banks in Finland) are
  required to
  perform &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; checks on accounts, this
  credential
  can also be used as sufficient verification by other financial
  institutions.
  This can help Jane assure destination banks that she is verified,
  thereby
  allaying concerns about misdirected transactions and money
  laundering.
