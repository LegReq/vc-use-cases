  <udef>H.5 Proving Legal Disability Status</udef>

<dd>
  Trina, who is legally blind, is currently unemployed, and needs to
  use the
  local free disability ride service to get to the employment office.
  To use
  this service, she is required to verify that she maintains legal
  disability
  status. Trina provides her government-issued disability credential
  to sign up
  for the ride service, and is not required to disclose her specific
  disability
  to the ride service, as this could put her at personal risk.
