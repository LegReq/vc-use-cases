  Thousands of people each year are displaced because of man-made and
  natural
  disasters. Anoushka is one such, having been forced to flee her
  village along
  with her mother and younger brother. They reach an IFRC center just
  across
  the border in a relatively safe area, but with no documentation.
  Since the
  government of her homeland is in turmoil, there is no way for the
  IFRC staff
  to easily establish their identities. Fortunately, Anoushka had been
  issued
  a self-sovereign proof of birth, attached to which is the proof of
  birth and
  marriage for her parents. She is able to retrieve this because it is
  available
  from many places often the Internet. Since it is verifiable, the
  IFRC is
  comfortable vouching for them and resettling them in a safer area
  for the
  duration of the conflict.
