  <udef>H.3 Insurance claim</udef>
</dt>
<dd>
  Tracy has a sore throat soon after moving to a new town. She finds a
  physician
  through her health care network and goes in for treatment. She is a
  new
  patient, so the clinic needs to know who she is and how she will be
  paying.
  When checking in, she presents her <a>verifiable credential</a> that
  demonstrates her identity and her proof of insurance. When the
  clinic submits
  this to the insurance company, they can automatically ascertain that
  she
  submitted her proof of identity and insurance to the provider and
  granted the
  physician the ability to submit the claim for payment.
