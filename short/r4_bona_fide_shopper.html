  David owns a restaurant and has registered with a low cost wholesaler to purchase provisions in bulk. The wholesaler has
  issued David with a credential to prove that he is entitled to enter the warehouse in order to purchase goods that are
  not available to the general public. The credential is marked "non-transferable" to stop David passing the credential to
  his friends to allow them to purchase low cost provisions.
