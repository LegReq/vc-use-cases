    Sam, the new device owner, needs to trust the device originated
    from HVAC
    Manufacturing and was handled correctly at Certifications Testing
    Lab and
    installed with the correct software package at VAR Resellers.
    After Sam
    verifies each of the <a>verifiable credentials</a>, he issues
    another
    <a>verifiable credential</a> for fan controller #37 which includes
    assertions
    relating to trust: device manufacturer model/version, software
    manufacturer
    model/version, security versions of components TCB, and associated
    devices the
    fan controller is authorized to interact with including
    thermostat-board-room.
  </p>
  <p>
    The thermostat-board-room monitors room temperature. When the
    temperature is
    too hot it switches the fan controller #37 on and later when the
    temperature
    reaches a comfortable level, off. The device makes sure the
    control signals
    from thermostat-board-room are authorized (namely, that Sam
    intended for
    thermostat-board-room to control the fan controller).
  </p>
  <p>
    Sam is concerned about the security of the smart board room. He
    configures
    the autonomously interacting devices to re-verify device
    trustworthiness
    attributes periodically by re-checking that the device originated
    from HVAC
    Manufacturing and was handled correctly by Certifications Testing
    Lab and
    installed with the correct software package by VAR Resellers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sam may update the deviceâ€™s software occasionally during its
    lifetime. Even
    though Sam is applying the update, VAR Resellers supplies the
    correct update.
    The device ensures that only VAR Resellers is able to supply the
    updated
    software image and that only Sam is able to apply the update.
