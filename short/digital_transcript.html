  Joleen is the registrar of Mega University and, by virtue of her
  office, is
  responsible for the integrity, accuracy, and security of academic
  records.
  Joleen has been a pioneering registrar in advocating an "extended
  transcript"
  that includes not only the standard set of course grades but also
  adds
  supplementary information on learner competencies. These might
  include work
  experiences and non-educational but marketable skills. Upon the
  request of her
  students, Joleen issues a digital credential that includes an
  extended
  transcript.
