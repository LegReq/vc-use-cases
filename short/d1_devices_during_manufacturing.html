    Bob, the director of production at HVAC Manufacturing, issues a
    device-identifying <a>verifiable credential</a> (e.g. IDevID, IAK)
    at the
    factory for an energy-saving fan controller IoT device.

    Carol, senior quality engineer at Certifications Testing Lab,
    issues a
    certification of specification-compliance <a>verifiable
      credential</a> to the
    fan-controller device at the certification lab during the
    manufacturing
    process.

  <p>
    When the fan controller is installed at the customer's office at
    Modern Office
    Spaces, the controller's identifying <a>credential</a> can be
    verified by Sam,
    IT technician, to establish the identity of the controller as part
    of the
    on-boarding of the new controller. The controller's
    specification-compliance
    <a>credential</a> is verified to demonstrate the controller's
    Energy-Star
    compliance.
