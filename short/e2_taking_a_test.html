  Eunice is about to take her ACT (a test used to evaluate her
  readiness for
  college). When she arrives at the testing center, she is required to
  present
  identification. Her government-issued identity certificate is
  acceptable, as
  the <a>verifiable credentials</a> contained in it reflect all of the
  required
  attributes and it is difficult to counterfeit.
